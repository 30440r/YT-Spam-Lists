# Crowd Sourced YouTube Comments Spam List:
## Various lists of known scam domains, fake scam accounts on Instagram, Telegram, etc.

### Current Lists:
- **Spam Domains**: Domains used in scam YouTube comments
- **Spam Accounts**: External social media accounts (instagram, telegram, etc) that are mentioned in scam comments as the point of contact for that particular scam. Usually these are scams advertising fake hacking services, free vbucks/robux, etc.
- **Spam Threads**: Accounts and Aliases (fake names of people) mentioned as the point of contact specifically in coordinated spam threads, where multiple spam bots pretend to have a conversation and end up 'recommending' the fake services of someone on another platform (usually an 'expert investor', and often involving crypto)

### How to Contribute:
- You can submit an **issue** with domains to add, but they MUST contain a direct link to a spam comment as proof, or a video on which many obvious spam comments are promoting the domain.
- Remember: A zero false positive rate must be the highest priority
- Please refrain from submitting pull requests, and instead just use issues as submissions. This will make it easier for me to manage the version/date and merge conflicts
